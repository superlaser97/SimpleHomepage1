Using this homepage is as simple as it gets.

1.  Download the `homepage.html` and `style.css` files.

### Editing Content

* **Page Title:** The main title at the top of the page ("Dashboard") is editable. Just click on it, type your new title, and click away.

* **Adding Items:** Use the "Add Shortcut", "Add Note", or "Add Reminder" button located at the top right of each tab to create a new item.

* **Editing & Deleting:** Hover your mouse over any shortcut, note, or reminder card. Edit (`‚úé`) and Delete (`üóëÔ∏è`) icons will appear in the top-right corner of the card.

*Caption: Editing a shortcut using the on-page modal.*

* **Managing Categories:**
    * When adding or editing a shortcut, you can assign it to a category.
    * To add a new category, click the "+ New" button in the category selector.
    * To edit or delete an existing category, hover over its name in the category selector to reveal controls.

### Customizing the View

Use the icons in the absolute top-right corner of the page to customize your experience.

* **Theme Switcher (‚òÄÔ∏è/üåô):** Instantly toggle between light and dark modes.
* **Style Switcher (Compact/Comfortable):** Change the layout density. "Compact" is great for smaller screens or showing more information at once.

Your theme and style preferences are automatically saved in your browser.

### Managing Your Data

You have full control over your configuration. Use the menu icons in the top-right corner to manage your setup.

*Caption: Easily import or export your configuration.*

* **Export (‚¨áÔ∏è):** Save your current setup (all shortcuts, notes, and reminders) to a JSON file or copy it to your clipboard. This is perfect for making backups or moving to a new computer.
* **Import (‚¨ÜÔ∏è):** Load a configuration from a JSON file or a string you've previously exported.
* **Reset (üîÑ):** This will completely wipe your current configuration and restore the page to its original default settings. **Use with caution!**

## Development

This section is for users who want to make significant changes to the visual style of the page by modifying the underlying CSS.

#### Prerequisites

* You must have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

#### Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to install Tailwind CSS:
    ```bash
    npm install tailwindcss
    ```

2.  **Start the Tailwind Watcher:**
    Run this command in your terminal. It will watch for any changes you make to the class names in `homepage.html` and automatically rebuild the `style.css` file.
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./style.css --watch
    ```
    Keep this process running while you are making style edits.
